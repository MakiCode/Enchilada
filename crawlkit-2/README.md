A crawler based on PhantomJS. Allows discovery of dynamic content and supports custom scrapers. For all your ajaxy crawling & scraping needs.

* Parallel crawling/scraping via Phantom pooling.
* Custom-defined link discovery.
* Custom-defined runners (scrape, test, validate, etc.)
* Can follow redirects (and because it's based on PhantomJS, JavaScript redirects will be followed as well as `<meta>` redirects.)
* Streaming
* Resilient to PhantomJS crashes
* Ignores page errors

## Install
```console
npm install crawlkit --save
```

## Usage
```javascript
const CrawlKit = require('crawlkit');
const anchorFinder = require('crawlkit/finders/genericAnchors');

const crawler = new CrawlKit('http://your/page');
crawler.setFinder({
    getRunnable: () => anchorFinder
});

crawler.crawl()
    .then((results) => {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(results, true, 2));
    }, (err) => console.error(err));
```
Also, have a look at the [samples](https://github.com/crawlkit/crawlkit/tree/master/examples).

## API
See the [API docs](http://crawlkit.github.io/crawlkit/docs/) (published) or the docs on [doclets.io](https://doclets.io/crawlkit/crawlkit/master) (live).

## Debugging
CrawlKit uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) for debugging purposes. In short, you can add `DEBUG="*"` as an environment variable before starting your app to get all the logs. A more sane configuration is probably `DEBUG="*:info,*:error,-crawlkit:pool*"` if your page is big.

## Contributing
Please contribute away :)

Please add tests for new functionality and adapt them for changes.

The commit messages need to follow the [conventional changelog format](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) so semantic-release picks the semver versions properly. It is probably easiest if you install [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen) via `npm install -g commitizen` and commit your changes via `git cz`.
